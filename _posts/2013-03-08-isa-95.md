The [ISA-95 standard][1] targets information exchange in and across the domain of operation's management,
which makes it highly applicable to the Openkas platform.

Originally, it is an international standard for developing an automated interface between enterprise (think ERP) and control systems. Later parts of the standard also describe message exchange between control systems in the operational domain. This standard has been developed for all kind of manufacturers; regardless of industry. It was developed to be applied in all industries, and in all sorts of processes, like batch processes, continuous and repetitive processes.

Future posts will address how to apply the ISA-95 standard to greenhouse horticulture.
